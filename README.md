Inspired by the anime show ***Sword Art Online: Alicization***, I took upon a challenge to create a
**real world virtual world** that has humans who reproduce and form civilizations and to the **become
the god of it**.

Instead of a virtual reality world portrayed in the show, I decided to create a *3D terrain* with
***minecraft** textures* lol. You can control the world typing commands that start with `/`. Also you 
can generate a vessel for yourself to live as a human and see what they are doing. Type `/help`
for finding the available commands as of now.

So far I have made a lot of progress, where humans have *food, predators, building materials and 
other stuffs, also a lot of command functionalities*. As far the progress goes, you can also create
a human for yourself and roam around with it. The only job thats mainly left is to make the AI of
the humans. To generate a vessel, you type `/generate vessel 0,0,0`. This creates a human body for
you. The controls are pretty much like minecraft including the building bit.

But then I lost motivation to pursue any longer with the project so I uploaded it to github and decided
to stop wasting time on it lmao.
